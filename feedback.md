### The bad

* Slightly fast
* Sometimes difficult to follow as the terminal screen flows a bit fast
* Too slow
* Some parts felt rushed
* The speed is alright, just I ama very slow learner. some pre-notes would be helpful in my case. (A list of functions to remind ppl of the previous functions?)
* First 1.5 hour a bit slow
* Wish we had more time to go over scripts and in more detailed commands
* More interactions
* Confused at the beinning to find the files. Probably if we had instructions may help better
* Only sometimes a bit fast the explanation
* Perhaps the speed could be a bit slower for beinners thanks
* Could have been delivered marginally quicker.

# Feedback - 30th Jan

## git

### The good
 * great session with easy to learn code :-)
 * I enjoyed it; a great intro to Git/Github
 * great professional examples; helped to visualize how this all works and how it could improve my work habits
 * I liked being introduced to github. "potentially useful" tool! Documents are great! Thanks.
 * good intro to git/good examples
 * well structured in general and explained, but reconsider having a general introduction showing the github interface
 * excellent presentation & pace. Please add the desktop version if there is time

### The bad
 * would like to have spent more time on git; was a lot of info to process but fun
 * bit fast through the admin/setup part, making it easy to fall behind. Perhaps have a separate step-by-step of setup next to working terminal
 * nothing negative
 * creating user account before attending the course
 * sometimes too quick; check audience follow up may help
 * I would have started the lesson with a general overview of the github webpage and some general comments on concepts that will be used through out the explanations like 'push', 'commit', etc
