### The bad

* Slightly fast
* Sometimes difficult to follow as the terminal screen flows a bit fast
* Too slow
* Some parts felt rushed
* The speed is alright, just I ama very slow learner. some pre-notes would be helpful in my case. (A list of functions to remind ppl of the previous functions?)
* First 1.5 hour a bit slow
* Wish we had more time to go over scripts and in more detailed commands
* More interactions
* Confused at the beinning to find the files. Probably if we had instructions may help better
* Only sometimes a bit fast the explanation
* Perhaps the speed could be a bit slower for beinners thanks
* Could have been delivered marginally quicker.
